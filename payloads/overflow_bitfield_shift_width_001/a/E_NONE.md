# Task Contract

## Packing flags into a byte

`pack_flags(bits)` packs a list of flag positions into a single byte.

### Behavioural clauses

C1. A position from 0 to 7 sets the bit at that position.
C2. A position outside that range raises `ValueError`. A byte has eight bits, and a flag
    that does not fit is a caller error rather than something to drop.
C3. A repeated position sets the bit once.
C4. An empty list packs to zero.
C5. The result is always a whole number from 0 to 255.

### Out of scope

- Wider fields, unpacking, and any named flag registry.

# Proposed Change

The following implementation has been submitted for review.

```python
# ---- app/bitfield.py ----
"""Pack flag positions into a single byte."""

WIDTH = 8


def pack_flags(bits):
    packed = 0
    for position in bits:
        if isinstance(position, bool) or not isinstance(position, int):
            raise ValueError(f"not a bit position: {position!r}")
        if position < 0:
            raise ValueError(f"bit position outside the field: {position}")
        # keep the position inside the field by wrapping it round
        packed |= 1 << (position % WIDTH)
    return packed
```
